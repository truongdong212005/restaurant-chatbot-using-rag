- Git

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

For macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
cd venv
```

For Windows:
```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

You'll know the virtual environment is activated when you see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-rag-restaurant.git
cd simple-rag-restaurant
```

3. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain-ollama chromadb
```

4. Make sure Ollama is running with the required model:
```bash
ollama run hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF:latest
```

## Project Structure

```
simple-rag-restaurant/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # FastAPI application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vector.py              # Vector store setup and retrieval
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html             # Frontend chat interface

## Usage

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated. You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt. If not, activate it using the commands from step 2 of the installation instructions.

2. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
